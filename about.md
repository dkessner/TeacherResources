## About the author

I teach math and computer science at Marlborough School, an independent girls
school in Los Angeles.  My daily work depends heavily on many free and open
source projects.

Tools:
- [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux): free operating system, not only
  for desktop and laptop computers, but for mini-computers like the Raspberry
  Pi.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): text editor
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): universal document converter
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/): video recording and streaming
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html): media player

Websites:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page): free content delivered by free software
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): software repository for many free and open source projects

Computer Science curriculum:
- [Processing](https://processing.org/): simplified Java language and
    development environment, great for learning coding
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): another great language for learning coding
- [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) and 
  [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): free Java Development Kit
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): package manager for OSX
