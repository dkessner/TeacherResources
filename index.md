# Welcome teachers!

This website is a collection of free and open source resources
for teachers.  

I am a teacher and software developer, and in the classroom I use
[free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), 
which is not only free of charge, but free of licensing and usage restrictions.
In addition to software, many other
[open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
are available online for teachers.

Have fun!
