## About these pages

The examples are written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), which is an
open source language and development environment used by students and artists
worldwide.  Processing is a simplified version of Java:  the syntax that you
learn in Processing is actually Java syntax, and as you learn to code, most
languages in the C/C++ family (of which Java is a member) will start to look
familiar to you.

This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  The pages are
written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
which GitHub converts to HTML with the static site generator
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  The style sheets are based on the [Jekyll
hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).  The Processing sketches
are embedded in the pages with [ProcessingJS](http://processingjs.org/).

You can copy or download the code on each example page.  And here is the
[source code](https://github.com/dkessner/ProcessingExamples) on GitHub.
