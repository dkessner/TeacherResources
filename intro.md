# Welcome teachers!

This website is a collection of free and open source resources
for teachers.  

I am a teacher and software developer, and in the classroom I use free and open
source software which is not only free of charge, but free of licensing and
usage restrictions.  In addition to software, many other open educational
resources are available online for teachers.

Have fun!
