# Coding resources 

## Organizations

- [Code.org](https://code.org/): coding tutorials, Hour of Code

- [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/): clubs and summer programs to
  close the gender gap in computer science

## Block-based programming

- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/): simple block-based programming for a
  first coding experience, suitable for all ages

- [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/): an reimplementation of Scratch from UC Berkeley, with
added features (user-defined blocks and first-class lists) to facilitate study of more
complex ideas in computer science


## Processing

Processing is a simplified version of Java that is used by educators and
artists worldwide.

- [Processing](https://processing.org): main website, with many tutorials

- [Open Processing](https://www.openprocessing.org/): user-contributed code projects and examples

- [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/): a free book on creative coding
from Daniel Shiffman, one of the creators of Processing

- [Processing Examples](https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingExamples/): some simple code examples
that we use at Marlborough School

- [Processing Library Examples](https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingLibraryExamples/): 
Processing is really a Java library, so it's useful for 
[AP Computer Science A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science_A).



## Python

Python is a really good language for learning text-based programming.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): main website, with more documentation and
  tutorials than you will ever need

- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/): Python coding in
  the browser (based on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)), combined with the
  sharing features of Google docs
