# Welcome teachers!

<br/>  

This website is a collection of free and open source resources
for teachers.  

<br/>  

I am a teacher and software developer, and I use free and open source software
extensively in the classroom.  I encourage you to learn more about 
[free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), 
which is not only free of charge, but free of licensing and usage restrictions.  

<br/>  

Have fun!

<br/>
